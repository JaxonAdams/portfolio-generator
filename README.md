# Portfolio Generator Node App
## Description
This is a back-end app using NodeJS and the command line. When you run the app (using the instructions below), it will use prompted information to build a simple portfolio website, automating the HTML and CSS normally required for a static webpage like this. The finished webpage will be saved in 'index.html' in the dist folder.
## Instructions
If you want to use this app, first clone the repository. Then run your choice of command line interface in the root of the repository. Run the app by using the command 'node app'. You will then be prompted with several questions which will be used to build your portfolio for you. Once you have answered all the prompts, the CLI will inform you of any errors that may have occured. If there were no errors, your portfolio has been built! View it in 'dist/index.html'. You can run the app again to update the webpage and your changes will be saved to the same file. Simply follow the previous steps and your site will be updated without a problem.
